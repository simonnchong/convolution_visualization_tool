DeepLab: CNN Workbench 🧠DeepLab is an interactive educational tool designed to demystify the "black box" of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It allows students, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to visualize exactly how mathematical operations transform images into feature maps.🌟 Key FeaturesInteractive Input Layer: Draw digits/shapes on a 14x14 grid or upload your own images (automatically resized and grayscaled).Real-Time Convolution: Visualizes the "sliding window" operation with customizable kernels (Edge Detection, Sharpen, Emboss, etc.).Mathematical Transparency: Hover over any pixel in the output to see the exact equation: (Input × Weight) + Bias = Output.Dynamic Parameters: Experiment with Kernel Size (3x3, 5x5), Stride, Padding, and Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).Animation Mode: Watch the scanner move step-by-step to understand the spatial relationship between input and output.🚀 Live DemoTry the tool directly in your browser:https://simonnchong.github.io/convolution_visualization_tool/🛠️ Tech StackFramework: ReactBuild Tool: ViteStyling: Tailwind CSSIcons: Lucide ReactDeployment: GitHub Pages (via GitHub Actions)💻 Running LocallyIf you want to run this on your own machine:Clone the repo:git clone [https://github.com/simonnchong/convolution_visualization_tool.git](https://github.com/simonnchong/convolution_visualization_tool.git)
